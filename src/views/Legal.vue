      <li>
        Approved payment methods of Furway are Vipps and Stripe (credit card).
      </li>
      <li>
        The ticket/slot is valid for the periods listed in the table listing ticket types and prices. The tickets are personal, and cannot be exchanged or shared with others. Changing your ticket type means you might lose a slot in the waiting lists, and possibly thus lose your approved slot at Furway.
      </li>
      <li>
        An invoice is not created until you have an assured slot at the arrangement corresponding to your ticket type. Paid tickets – that is, approved registrations with corresponding fully paid invoice – are not refunded.
      </li>
      <li>
        Minor changes in the convention schedule may occur, and cancellation of single activities is not grounds for ticket refunds. Should the entire convention be cancelled for any reason, tickets will be refunded.
      </li>
      <li>
        Failure to comply with the terms and conditions agreement, or residing at Furway in ways not stipulated in the ticket type, is grounds for eviction from the arrangement unless otherwise countermanded by the board. Furway reserves the right to deny registrations without given reason.

        Godkjente betalingsmetoder for Furway er Vipps og Stripe (bankkort).
      </li>
      <li>
        Billetten gjelder for periodene beskrevet i tabellen med pris- og billettyper, er personlig og kan ikke deles med flere. Bytte av billettype kan medføre tap av ventelisteplass, og således tap av godkjent plass på arrangementet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Faktura opprettes ikke før du har en definitiv reservert plass tilsvarende billettype, på arrangementet. Kjøpte billetter – registreringer med godkjent plass på arrangementet og påfølgende betalt faktura – refunderes ikke.
      </li>
      <li>
        Endringer i program kan forekomme, og evt. kansellering av enkeltaktiviteter vil ikke medføre rett til refusjon av billetten. Refusjon gis kun ved avlysning av hele arrangementet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mislighold av ordensregler, eller opphold på Furway som ikke er stipulert av billettype, er grunnlag for utkastelse uten refusjon med mindre annet besluttes av styret. Furway forbeholder seg retten til å nekte registrering uten begrunnelse.
